# Merchant Market Place UI
This project is part of the CryptoBank Payment System program.

## Purpose
This project is the user interface of a DApp market place designed for merchants with the intention of selling digital products online.

### Merchants
These merchants prefer to receive their payments in local fiat of their country and do not care what the original currency of payment by a buyer is.

### Buyers
Buyers are tech and crypto savy.  They would love to make purchases online while paying with crypto currency

## IPFS

IPFS is used in this project to enable off-chain and decentralised storage of digital products on the private IPFS gaetway of CryptoBank
